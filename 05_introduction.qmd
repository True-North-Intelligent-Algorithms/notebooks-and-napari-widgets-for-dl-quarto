## Outline

* Napari basics
* Train/Validate on one image
    * with Napari ROIs

## Outline

* Sparse
    * Stardist with sparse labels
* Scale
    * Cellpose at different scales
    * Stardist receptive field
    * thin protrusions
    * Lady bugs at different scales

## Outline

* Segment anything and everything (SAM)
    * visualizing overlapping SAM labels
    * Segment everything and filter

## Instance segmentation

## Training, Validation and Test sets

* Training - data that is input to the model
    * ideally get almost 'perfect' results when predicting on training set
* Validation 
    * Data not fed to model
    * used to tune parameters during training.  
* Test 
    * unseen partition 
    * used to evaluate how well model generalize
