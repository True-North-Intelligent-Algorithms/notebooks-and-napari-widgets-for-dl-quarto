## Outline

* Introduction
* Napari basics
* Organizing Deep Learning Projects
* Train/Validate on one image
    * with Napari ROIs

## Outline

* Sparse
    * Stardist with sparse labels
* Scale
    * Cellpose at different scales
    * Stardist receptive field
    * thin protrusions
    * Lady bugs at different scales

## Outline

* Segment anything and everything (SAM)
    * visualizing overlapping SAM labels
* Segment everything and filter

## Instance segmentation

## Why notebooks ? 

* Can be useful for developers and non-developers
* Visual
* Compromise between GUI and Code

## Why Widgets ?

* Complimentary to notebooks
* Need a GUI for some DL steps 
    * Can't draw labels with code
* Marketing term ?
    * Not quite ready for prime time

## Training, Validation and test sets

* Training - data that is input to the model
    * ideally get almost 'perfect' results when predicting on training set
    * Or dl approach not appropriate for problem
* Validation 
    * Data not fed to model
    * used to tune parameters during training.  
    * Hints at how well model generalizes but can be deceptive. 

## Training, Validation and test sets
* Test 
    * unseen partition 
    * used to evaluate how well model generalize
    * as soon as we see it becomes validation
